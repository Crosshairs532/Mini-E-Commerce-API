## Dependencies & dev-dependencies:

1.

## Assumptions made:

- NO media or image is needed for now.
- Only product, description , stock and price is there. others are excluding for simplicity.
- Assuming basic product search Functionality. Search product on only name and Description
- instead deleting the whole product, Updating isDeleted field on product. So that we do not have to create the product from the beginning.
